Majorsss:
Line 45 - Redundant fallback function 
Details:
The payment rejection fallback is redundant.

Contracts should reject unexpected payments. Before Solidity 0.4.0, it was done manually:


function () { revert(); }

Starting from Solidity 0.4.0, contracts without a fallback function automatically revert payments, making the code above redundant.
